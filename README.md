# Chinese Calligraphy Character Recognition
Chinese calligraphy character recognition via transfer learning. 

Data are collected from [a online chinese calligraphy dictionary](https://www.shufadict.com/dict/x).

__In progress...__

## Motivation
A chinese calligraphy character can be written in different forms, so it requires a lot of experience to be able to recognise all characters.

Eg. Sample data of the character "æ€»"

## Limitations
Currently, the model is trained to recognise -
- 100 most common chinese characters
- One specific style, which is the semi-cursive script
